desmos-inspired scientific calculator (first ever complete project :D)

scientific calculator that can handle multiple expressions, nested parenthesis, and keyboard functionality with input validation. also comes with descriptive error messages depending on what went wrong with the formation of the math expression. will potentially add functionality in the future to support derivatives, integrals, summation notation, and possibly importing a LaTeX library to make the expressions more user-friendly to type out. try it out for yourself and let me know if you find any bugs!
languages used: html, css, javascript
